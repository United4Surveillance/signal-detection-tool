# Code of Conduct

We treat each other with respect and use respectful language in all discussions

We are proactive and we all strive to contribute to the project

We give constructive feedback. For pull requests in particular:
- we always give praise even if we need to reject the PR
- we outline areas of improvement to the code regardless of our review decision

When we would like to work on an issue that is already assigned to someone else, we reach out to that person and ask what the status is and if we might take over. We don't just take the issue from them.
