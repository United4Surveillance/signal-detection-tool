# SignalDetectionTool

## Overview

A shiny app for automated detection of signals in infectious disease
surveillance data. A signal is an anomaly in an infectious disease
surveillance time series.  
This app allows the user to investigate generated signals and
corresponding surveillance time series. It includes upload of csv or
Excel files, data checks, possibility to set parameters for signal
detection, visualisation of results and generation of reports. The tool
is interactive and flexible so that it can be used in different contexts
and customised to the user’s needs.

## Installation and running the app

You can install the most recent release of the SignalDetectionTool from
[GitHub](https://github.com/United4Surveillance/signal-detection-tool)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("United4Surveillance/signal-detection-tool")
```

To run the app you need to type:

``` r
library(SignalDetectionTool)
run_app()
```

Another way to install the tool is downloading the appropriate file
found under
[Releases](https://github.com/United4Surveillance/signal-detection-tool/releases).

**Detailed Installation Guideline for the Files in Releases**

**Navigating to the Release Page**

- Scroll up and look on the right-hand side of the page under a section
  labelled **Releases**.
- Click on **Releases** to access the latest tool release.
- There are three different files you can download.

  

**Source Code (tar.gz)**

This is a tarball. You must have Rtools installed on your computer to
use this installation method. If you only want to run the app and use
its functionalities, this is the correct installation for you. In case
you are interested in modifying the code of the app, go to **Source Code
(zip)**.

- Download the provided `.tar.gz` file and save it on your computer.
- Install the package `remotes` by putting `install.packages(“remotes”)`
  in the console.
- Install the package dependencies for the SignalDetectionTool using the
  full path where you stored the `.tar.gz` file. Replace `x.x.x` with
  the current version of the binary. For example:
  `remotes::install_deps(“C:/Users/YourUsername/Downloads/SignalDetectionTool_x.x.x.tar.gz”)`
- Execute this command in the console.
- This should also install any dependencies you need to run the tool.
  Wait until the installation finishes successfully.
- Write the following command into the console to install the tool:
  `install.packages(“path_to_the_tool/SignalDetectionTool_x.x.x.tar.gz”, repos = NULL, type=“source”)`
- Go back above the detailed installation instructions to read how to
  run the app.

**SignalDetectionTool_x.x.x.zip**

This is a binary. You do not need to have Rtools installed on your
computer to use this installation method.

  `DESCRIPTION` file using `remotes::install_version()`.
- If `devtools::install_deps()` gives an error (e.g., ‘no package called
  devtools’), install it with: `install.packages(“devtools”)`, then run
  the command again.
- To install the SignalDetectionTool, go to RStudio’s ‘Build’ tab (top
  right window) and click ‘Install’.
- Go back above the detailed installation instructions to read how to
  run the app.

## Usage

The shiny application is structured into a **Help**, **Data**, **Input
parameters**, **Signals** and **Report** tab.  
You can try the shiny application yourself using [test
data](https://github.com/United4Surveillance/signal-detection-tool/blob/main/dev/data/input/input.csv)
provided with the package.

### Help

The Help tab provides more information to the user how to use the app
and details about settings in the individual tabs and signal detection
algorithms.

### Data

[Here](https://github.com/United4Surveillance/signal-detection-tool/blob/main/dev/data/input/description.md)
is the description of the required data format to use the app. The input
format is a line list of infectious disease cases. In the data tab the
user can upload surveillance data (Excel or csv) for which the signal
detection should be performed. A data format check is automatically run
once the data file has been uploaded and feedback is provided to the
user. Alternatively you can also view the required input format using:

``` r
library(SignalDetectionTool)
View(input_metadata)
```

### Input parameters

In the Input parameters tab you can configure the signal detection you
want to perform. You can specify filters, stratification variables, time
periods and the signal detection algorithm which should be used. For
some algorithms, a pandemic correction can be applied, incorporating an
interrupted time series analysis into the outbreak detection methods.

### Signals

The Signals tab can look like this when using the test data and
stratification by age group, county and sex and using a timetrend
algorithm with pandemic correction:
![](reference/figures/README-signals_tab.PNG)![](reference/figures/README-timeseries.PNG)![](reference/figures/README-signal_detection_table.PNG)

### Report

In the Report tab HTML and Word reports can be generated showing the
results of the Signals Tab. Reports can also be generated using the
[`run_report()`](https://united4surveillance.github.io/signal-detection-tool/reference/run_report.md)
function.

## Data Configuration File

There is the possibility to start the app with a predefined
configuration. This means you don’t have to go through all the manual
steps like selecting an input file, specifying stratification or
choosing an algorithm. To use this functionality simply alter the
command to start the app. Instead of
[`run_app()`](https://united4surveillance.github.io/signal-detection-tool/reference/run_app.md)
you can use `run_app(path_to_yaml="./path/config_file.yaml")`. An
example yaml file is part of the external data of the
SignalDetectionTool package and can also be found here: [data config
example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/United4Surveillance/signal-detection-tool/refs/heads/main/inst/extdata/data_config_example.yml).

The YAML file needs to adhere to a particular structure and parameter
values. It consists of mappings, sequences, and scalars that configure
data sources, analytical settings, and pathogen-specific overrides.

### Config File Structure

The YAML document is organized into **root keys**, each representing a
distinct configuration profile.

#### 1. **Default Configuration (`default`)**

The `default` root key provides global settings applied unless
overridden by pathogen-specific mappings.

##### **Data Source (`datasource`)** *(Mapping)*

Specifies how input data is retrieved. Currently only supports file
based data sources out of the box. - `file` *(Scalar: Boolean)*  
- `TRUE` → Use an external file (CSV or Excel).  
- `FALSE` → Use a database.  
- `filepath` *(Scalar: String)* Path to the external file, applicable
when `file: TRUE`.  
- `db` *(Nested Mapping)* Child elements define database connection
details (used when `file: FALSE`).  
- `host` *(Scalar: String)* – Database server address (e.g.,
`localhost`).  
- `port` *(Scalar: Integer)* – Database port (e.g., `5432`).  
- `database` *(Scalar: String)* – Name of the database.

Do note that there is no true database support right now! The DB related
parameters are merely placeholders at the moment. To actually connect
your own database to the tool, you will need to [define custom functions
and apply monkey
patching](https://gist.github.com/mlbach/0a75ffa695f81e0d777973d3928d9013).
We plan to add full database support in the future.

##### **Analysis Parameters (`params`)** *(Mapping)*

Defines key variables for analysis and signal detection.  
- `pathogen` *(Scalar: String)* – Default pathogen under analysis (e.g.,
*Pertussis*).  
- `strata` *(Sequence of Scalars: List of Strings)* – Categories used to
stratify the analysis (e.g., `age_group`, `community`).  
- `signal_detection_period` *(Scalar: Integer)* – Time period (in weeks
or months) for detecting signals.  
- `signal_detection_algorithm` *(Scalar: String)* – Method used for
signal detection (e.g., `ears`).  
- `pandemic_correction`: *(Scalar: Boolean)* Correct for the effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic, only used in GLM algorithms -
`intervention_date`: *(Scalar: String, Date format `YYYY-MM-DD`)* - Date
for the intervention in the pandemic correction models

##### **Shapefile Path (`shapefile_path`)** *(Scalar: Null or String)*

Specifies the file path for geographic boundary data. The `~` value
indicates that no shapefile is provided.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2. **Pathogen-Specific Mappings**

In addition to the default configuration, you can also define
pathogen-specific configurations as another root key. These mappings
inherit values from `default` unless explicitly overridden.  
This way it is possible to adjust parameters and algorithm choice to the
pathogen of interest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the tool might only recognize and use certain values supplied
via the config file. Currently, there is a limited set of valid values
for stratification and algorithm choice. Possible strata values: -
None - age_group - state - country - county - community - sex

Possible algorithms values: - “farrington” - “ears” - “cusum” - “glm
mean” - “glm timetrend” - “glm harmonic” - “glm harmonic with
timetrend” - “glm farrington” - “glm farrington with timetrend”

In the future we will strive to make the tool even more flexible and
convenient.

## Development Process and Contribution

The tool development is an open source development process. The
participants of Work Package 2.2 of the [United4Surveillance
project](https://united4surveillance.eu/) will be the maintainers of the
repository and can contribute directly, third parties can contribute via
pull requests. The maintainers are meeting regularly to discuss pull
requests, issues and to add new issues according to the collected
requirements. Maintainers and contributors can work independently on
issues. For more information on how to contribute, please see our
[contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/United4Surveillance/signal-detection-tool/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap

The initial version of the tool (0.1.0) was deployed in April 2024 to
eleven European public health institutes for piloting. The official
piloting phase ended in November 2024. The tool can and is used after
November 2024 and will still be developed further.  
Some key features we want to develop are:

- possibility to aggregate the time series on different levels
  i.e. daily, biweekly, monthly,…
- possibility to combine stratifications
- retrieve linelist with cases corresponding to signals generated
