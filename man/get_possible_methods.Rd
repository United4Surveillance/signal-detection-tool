\title{Determine Possible Outbreak Detection Methods Based on Available Historic Data}
\usage{
get_possible_methods(min_date, max_date, number_of_weeks = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{min_date}{A \code{Date} object, the minimum date in the time series
used for fitting a model.}

\item{max_date}{A \code{Date} object, the maximum date in the time series
used for fitting a model.}

\item{number_of_weeks}{Integer. Number of weeks at the end of the time series
that are reserved for detection / monitoring and therefore not counted as
historic data for model fitting. Default is \code{6}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of possible algorithm names. Returns \code{NULL}
  if no method is applicable.
}
\description{
This function identifies which algorithms can be applied for outbreak detection
depending on the amount of historic data available for model fitting. The
decision is based on the minimum and maximum dates of the time series and the
number of weeks reserved at the end of the series (e.g. for current detection).
}
\details{
Historic data is defined as the period from \code{min_date} to
\code{max_date - number_of_weeks}. The number of available weeks is computed
on this interval, counting partial weeks as full weeks to match the weekly
aggregation used by the algorithms.

The method selection criteria are approximately:
\itemize{
  \item If 4 years (about 208 weeks) or more of historic data are available:
        all methods are possible.
  \item If 3 to <4 years (about 156 to <208 weeks) of historic data are
        available: all methods except \code{"glm farrington"} and
        \code{"glm farrington with timetrend"} are possible.
  \item If 2 to <3 years (about 104 to <156 weeks) of historic data are
        available: all methods except \code{"glm farrington"},
        \code{"glm farrington with timetrend"} and
        \code{"glm harmonic with timetrend"} are possible.
  \item If 26 to <104 weeks of historic data are available:
        \code{"Mean"}, \code{"CUSUM"} and \code{"EARS"} are possible.
  \item If 7 to <26 weeks of historic data are available:
        \code{"Mean"} and \code{"CUSUM"} are possible.
  \item If 1 to <7 weeks of historic data are available:
        \code{"CUSUM"} is possible.
  \item If no training data is available (less than 1 week),
        \code{NULL} is returned.
}


The function computes
\code{max_date_fit = max_date - number_of_weeks} and then calculates the
number of weeks between \code{min_date} and \code{max_date_fit}. Partial
weeks are counted as full weeks to align with the weekly aggregation of the
data. Based on this number of historic weeks, suitable algorithms are
selected using \code{\link{available_algorithms}}.
