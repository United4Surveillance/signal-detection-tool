\title{Determine Possible Outbreak Detection Methods Based on Available Data}
\usage{
get_possible_methods(min_date, max_date, number_of_weeks = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{min_date}{Date, minimum date in the time series used for fitting a model}

\item{max_date}{Date, maximum date in the time series used for fitting a model}

\item{number_of_weeks}{Integer, number of weeks to include for model fitting.
Default is \code{6}.}
}
\value{
A character vector of possible algorithm names. Returns \code{NULL} if
        no method is applicable.
}
\description{
This function identifies which algorithms can be applied for outbreak detection
depending on the number of weeks available for model fitting. The selection is
based on the minimum and maximum dates in the dataset and the specified parameters
for fitting.
}
\details{
The method selection criteria are:
- If 4 years (208 weeks) or more of data are available: All  methods are possible.
- If at least 3 of historic data are available: All methods except "glm farrington" and "glm farrington with timetrend" are possible.
- If at least 2 years of historic data are available: Same methods as above except for "glm harmonic with timetrend".
- If at least 26 weeks of historic data are available: Mean, CUSUM and Ears are possible.
- If at least 7 weeks of historic data is available: Mean and CUSUM are available.
- If at least 1 week of historic data is available: CUSUM is possible.
- If no training data is availble `NULL` is returned

The function calculates the number of weeks available for fitting and
selects appropriate algorithms based on that. The more historical data available,
the more complex models can be used.
