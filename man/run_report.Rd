}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame containing surveillance data in linelist format}

\item{report_format}{format of the report: HTML or DOCX}

\item{method}{algorithm to be use, one of \code{available_algorithms()}}

\item{number_of_weeks}{number of weeks for which signals are generated}

\item{strata}{A character vector specifying the columns to stratify
the analysis. Default is NULL.}

\item{interactive}{Logical (only applicable to HTML report)}

\item{tables}{Logical. True if tables should be included in report.}

\item{output_file}{The name of the output file \link[rmarkdown]{render}}

\item{output_dir}{The output directory for the rendered output file \link[rmarkdown]{render}}

\item{signals_padded}{calculated and padded signals (for use within the app, default is NULL)}

\item{signals_agg}{aggregated signals  (for use within the app, default is NULL)}

\item{intervention_date}{A date object or character of format yyyy-mm-dd or NULL specifying the date for the intervention in the pandemic correction models. Default is NULL which indicates that no intervention is done.}
}
\value{
the compiled document is written into the output file, and the path of the output file is returned; see \link[rmarkdown]{render}
}
\description{
If executed as a standalone function, all filtering must
be performed beforehand.
This function is also invoked within the app.
