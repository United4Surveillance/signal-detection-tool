\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame containing surveillance data in linelist format following the format specified in `input_metadata`}

\item{report_format}{character, format of the report: "HTML" or "DOCX"}

\item{method}{a character string, signal detection method to be used. One of "FarringtonFlexible", "EARS" , "CUSUM", "Mean", "Timetrend", "Harmonic", "Harmonic with timetrend", "Step harmonic", "Step harmonic with timetrend".
You can retrieve the full list using [names(available_algorithms())].}

\item{number_of_weeks}{integer, number of weeks for which signals are generated}

\item{pathogens}{A character vector specifying which pathogens should be included in report.}

\item{strata}{A character vector specifying the columns to stratify. If `NULL` no strata are used.
the analysis. Default is NULL.}

\item{interactive}{Logical, indicating whether interactive elements should be included in the report. Only applicable when `report_format = "HTML"`. Defaults to `TRUE`.}

\item{tables}{Logical. True if tables should be included in report.}

\item{output_file}{A character string specifying the name of the output file (without directory path). If `NULL` (default), the file name is automatically generated to be SignalDetectionReport. See \link[rmarkdown]{render} for more details.}

\item{output_dir}{A character string specifying the output directory for the rendered output file (default is ".", which means the rendered file will be saved in the current working directory. See \link[rmarkdown]{render} for more details. `NULL` is used when running the report from shiny app which will take the Downloads folder as default option for saving.}

\item{signals_padded}{List of calculated and padded signals (for use within the app, default is NULL)}

\item{signals_agg}{List of aggregated signals  (for use within the app, default is NULL)}

\item{intervention_date}{A date object or character of format yyyy-mm-dd or NULL specifying the date for the intervention. This can be used for interrupted timeseries analysis. It only works with the following methods: "Mean", "Timetrend", "Harmonic", "Harmonic with timetrend", "Step harmonic", "Step harmonic with timetrend". Default is NULL which indicates that no intervention is done.}
}
\value{
the compiled document is written into the output file, and the path of the output file is returned; see \link[rmarkdown]{render}
}
\description{
If executed as a standalone function, all filtering must
be performed beforehand.
This function is also invoked within the app.
