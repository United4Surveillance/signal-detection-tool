\title{Prepare the signal detection results for creation of table with results}
\usage{
process_signals_for_table(data, positive_only = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame containing signals from \code{\link{get_signals()}}}

\item{positive_only}{Logical indicating whether to filter only those signal results where a signal was generated (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
data.frame
}
\description{
This function converts the columns week, year and cases to integer, columns are renamed and category with NA is replaced by None. It can
filter the data based on the `positive_only` parameter giving back only those data points where a signal was found.

data <- data.frame(
