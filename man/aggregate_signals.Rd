\title{Aggregate cases and signals for the number of weeks given stratum and category.
First the signals are filtered to obtain the signals for the last n weeks,
aggregating the number of cases observed, create variable any alarm generated and the aggregate the number of alarms}
\usage{
aggregate_signals(signals, number_of_weeks)
}
\arguments{
\item{signals}{tibble, output of the \code{\link{get_signals}} function with number of cases and alarm per week, year}

\item{number_of_weeks}{integer, specifying the number of weeks we want to aggregate the number of cases and the generated alarms}
}
\value{
tibble, with one line per groups containing the number of cases, any_alarms and n_alarms
}
