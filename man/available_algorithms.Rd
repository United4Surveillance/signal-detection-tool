\title{List Available Signal Detection Algorithms}
\usage{
available_algorithms()
}
\value{
A named character vector of available algorithms. The names are shown in the app to the user, and #'   the values represent the internal method names to be used in function calls.
}
\description{
This function returns a named character vector of the signal detection algorithms
currently supported by the package. The names describe the algorithm shown in the shiny app,
and the corresponding values are the method identifiers used when calling functions internally
like [get_signals()].
