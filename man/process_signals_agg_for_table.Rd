\title{Prepares aggregated signals of one category for producing a table.}
\usage{
process_signals_agg_for_table(signals_agg)
}
\arguments{
\item{signals_agg}{A tibble or data.frame containing aggregated signals produced from \code{\link{aggregate_signals(signals,number_of_weeks = 6)}} for only one category}

\item{interactive}{Logical indicating whether to create an interactive
DataTable (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
tibble with preprocessed aggregated signals
}
\description{
It expects the aggregated signals input to only have one category. It converts certain columns
to integers and the stratum column to factor with NA converted to unknown for styling
purposes. It orders the strata by the factor levels. This table is used to show stratified signal results for one category, i.e. sex
and results for all the strata no matter whether there are signals or not.
