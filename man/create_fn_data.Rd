\title{Create a data.frame with 10 seasgroups components for harmonic modeling.}
\usage{
create_fn_data(ts_length, freq = 52.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts_length}{integer, specifying the length of the time series for which the seasonal group data is to be generated.}

\item{freq}{integer, default 52, specifying the frequency of the time series (e.g., 52 for weekly data).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the seasonal groupings (`seasgroups`) for the specified time series length. These seasonal groupings are used as covariates in the Farrington GLM model to account for seasonality.
}
\description{
This function generates seasonal group data required for fitting a Farrington-like Generalized Linear Model (GLM). The function leverages the `surveillance` package to create a dataset that includes seasonal groupings based on historical data, which is particularly useful for modeling seasonality in time series data.

# Generate seasonal group data for a time series of length 100 with weekly frequency
create_fn_data(100)
