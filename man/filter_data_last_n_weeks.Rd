\title{Filter the data so that only the data of the last n weeks are returned
This function can be used to filter for those last n weeks where alarms were generated. For this we could use is.na(alarms) but because it might happen that algorithms generate NA for an alarm this function is the safer option.}
\usage{
filter_data_last_n_weeks(data_agg, number_of_weeks)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_agg}{data.frame, aggregated surveillance or signals dataset, where aggregated means no linelist but cases or signals per week, year}

\item{number_of_weeks}{integer, specifying the number of weeks from the most recent week we want to filter the data for}
}
\value{
data.frame, aggregated data of last n weeks
}
