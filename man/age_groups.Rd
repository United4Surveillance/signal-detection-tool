\title{Create age grouping variable for a given data set}
\usage{
age_groups(df, break_at = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing at least one of the columns `age` or
`age_group`. If `age_group` already exists, it is not recomputed but only
reformatted and its levels are completed.}

\item{break_at}{An integer vector specifying additional lower bounds of
age groups (excluding 0, which is always used as the first lower bound).
If `NULL` (the default), 5-year age groups 00-04, 05-09, ..., 125+ are used.}
}
\value{
The input data frame `df` with a factor column `age_group` added
  (or reformatted) and levels stored in `app_cache_env$age_group_levels`.
}
\description{
If `df$age_group` already exists, it is only reformatted and recoded as a
factor with complete, ordered levels. Otherwise a new `age_group` variable
is created based on `df$age`.
}
\details{
Ages are grouped into intervals of the form `"LL-UU"` or `"LL+"`, with
lower and upper bounds zero-padded to two digits.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
input_path <- "data/input/input_sample.csv"
data <- read.csv(input_path, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
data$age <- sample(1:125, 10, replace = TRUE)
age_groups(data) # default age groups
age_groups(data, c(15L, 35L, 65L, 100L)) # custom age groups (lower bounds)
}
